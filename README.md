# Open Ai Sandbox App

This is a sandbox app for the OpenAI API. It is a Flutter app that gets user's input via Speech to Text and then sends it to the OpenAI API. The response from the API is then read out loud via Text to Speech. It was only tested on Web. 

## Getting Started
- Add your Open AI API key to the `.env_example` file.
- Rename the `.env_example` file to `.env`
- Run the app using `flutter run -d chrome`
